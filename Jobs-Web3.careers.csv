14,Senior Software Engineer (MetaMask Core),MetaMask, United States,"dev,senior,react,ethereum,javascript,node","About MetaMask

We‚Äôre building for a future where the internet and world economy empowers people, instead of treating people like a product. Where our interactions are based on consent, privacy, and people freely associating with one another. Where communities can flourish and individuals can pursue their dreams. To accomplish that, we‚Äôre working hard to make web3 more accessible for everyone.

MetaMask is both a blockchain wallet and a gateway to the entire decentralized web. Our tools help people create communities, play video games, access financial services, make payments, invest in assets, survive economic turmoil, and more use cases than we can even predict. We exist across multiple platforms (browser extension and mobile), and we serve the whole decentralized ecosystem.

We're Hiring for MetaMask Core

One defining aspect of engineering at MetaMask is that we don‚Äôt maintain servers or databases. All of our users data is stored either locally on device or on the blockchain. Meanwhile, real time updates to data that is rendered to the user depends on our connection with external sources that draw from on-chain data.

Managing data in this context is a unique and interesting challenge. The need for data integrity, security and privacy is very high within a wallet. To meet this need, we build and maintain MetaMask Controllers, a ‚ÄúCollection of platform-agnostic modules for creating secure data models for cryptocurrency wallets‚Äù.

MetaMask Controllers is the data management layer at the core of our browser extension and mobile app code. Currently, all of mobile‚Äôs functionality and a large amount of the extension‚Äôs functionality depends on this code. We are currently pursuing a goal of fully unifying this data management layer across mobile and extension.

Once we achieve this, we will grow MetaMask controllers into a ‚Äúwallet SDK‚Äù. This will be an internal product that will form the foundation of our extension and mobile products, our dapp API, as well as future products (e.g. a native Desktop Client).

We are looking for engineers to help build the core of MetaMask. This should be an exciting opportunity for engineers passionate about api design, data architecture, building javascript modules for other engineers, unit tests, code abstraction, wallet standardization and/or building SDKs.

Who we are looking for


Be growth-minded, collaborative, and can enjoy some amount of ambiguity, autonomy, and freedom to experiment
Improve MetaMask through effective review of pull requests, triaging and analysis of GitHub issues, auditing and refactoring the codebase, and testing
Proactively contribute to team discussions about technical issues, sprint and roadmap planning, and improving team processes
Be proficient and thoughtful with asynchronous and synchronous communication, giving and receiving feedback, and working independently and with a team
Support their teammates‚Äô performance and growth
Be successful working within a fully remote environment
Bring respect, patience, and empathy to every interaction and relationship with coworkers and the community
Bring hustle, enthusiasm, heart and a love of shipping code and fixing bugs to their work


Technical Requirements

We are hiring at varying levels of experience. Most successful candidates will have at least a couple years of production experience. Meanwhile, there are key opportunities for individuals looking for very senior roles and responsibilities.

Successful candidates will be proficient, or be able to quickly become proficient, in the following areas:


JavaScript and TypeScript
React and Redux
Architecting and implementing APIs (for servers, services or libraries) in a Node.js context
Some or all of: Node.js streams, Service Workers, generators, Observables, WebSockets
Browsers and browser APIs
Front-end build tools: Grunt, Gulp, webpack, or similar
Testing: unit, integration, end-to-end


Bonus Points:


Security engineering
Ethereum dapp development
Involvement in EIP authoring or review processes
Refactoring large, complex codebases

You‚Äôre independently-minded and self-motivated. You also enjoy the benefits of a remote-first team and the opportunities to collaborate with your teammates.
You have research experience in (algorithmic) game theory, mechanism design, microeconomics, market structure, financial engineering, econometrics, computer science, mathematics, blockchain protocols or other relevant domains.
